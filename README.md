## 📖 Description

A small personal project: creating a simple calculator using **HTML**, **CSS (via TailwindCSS)**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**.  
The goal was to learn how to:
- Manipulate the DOM
- Handle `click` events

- Dynamically process calculations using `eval()` (to be improved later for better security)

- ✅ Dynamic numeric display
- ✅ Numbers from 0 to 9
- ✅ Basic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- ✅ `=` button to display the result
